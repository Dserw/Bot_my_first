# Bot_my_first
This bot provides weather information for any city in the world. To use the bot, simply send it the name of the city you want to know the weather for.
The bot will then send you a message with the current temperature, wind speed, and sunrise and sunset times for that city.

The bot uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data. The OpenWeatherMap API is a reliable and accurate source of weather data,
so you can be confident that the information the bot provides is correct.
